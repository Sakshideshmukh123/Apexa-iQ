**Basic terminology to Know Before Learning Apexa iQ**

- **General Meaning of Assets**

Anything valuable that a person, company, or organization owns. These can be used to create money, provide benefits, or increase value.

- **What are IT Assets?**

IT assets are valuable resources like computers, software, data, or network systems that an organization owns and uses for work.**Example:** Assets that need internet connection in a home: TV, Wi-Fi, Mobile, AC, Smartwatch.

- **Audits**

A careful check or examination of something to make sure everything is correct and follows rules.**In IT:** Checking computers, software, and data to make sure they are safe, updated, and properly used.**Storage:** IT audits are stored digitally in reports, databases, or system logs.

- **Compliance**

Following rules, laws, regulations, or standards that apply to you or your organization.

**Asset Compliance**

Making sure all IT assets (computers, software, servers, network devices, etc.) follow the rules, standards, and policies set by the organization or law.

**Who decides the rules?**

- **Government / Regulatory Authorities** – Example: GDPR, HIPAA, IT Act
- **Industry Standards / Organizations** – Example: ISO 27001, CIS Benchmarks
- **Company / Internal Policies** – Example: Password rules, allowed software, backup policies


- **Obsolescence**

When something becomes old, outdated, or no longer useful because newer or better versions exist.**IT Asset Obsolescence:** When an IT asset (computer, server, software, device) becomes outdated, no longer supported, or cannot meet current business/security needs.

**Why it matters:**

- Increases security risks
- Reduces productivity
- Causes higher maintenance costs
- Leads to non-compliance

- **Vulnerability**

A weak spot in IT systems that can cause security problems.

**Examples in IT:**

- **Software Vulnerability:** Bug in Windows/Linux that hackers can exploit
- **Hardware Vulnerability:** Flaws in servers or devices
- **Network Vulnerability:** Open ports, weak passwords, unsecured Wi-Fi

- **Cloud Computing**

Using the internet to access storage, servers, software, or databases instead of keeping them on your own computer. **Example:** Google Drive, AWS, Azure.

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**

A cloud service where you use software through the internet without installing it on your computer. The provider handles updates, security, and maintenance.

**Examples of SaaS:**

- Gmail
- Google Docs / Microsoft Office 365
