    <h3>Prerequisites to know before knowing to Apexa iQ</h3>
    <p>>General Meaning of Assets:
    Anything valuable that a person, company, or organization owns.
    These can be used to create money, provide benefits, or increase value.</p>
    <p>>What are IT assets:
        IT assets are valuable resources like computers, software, data, or network systems that an organization owns and uses for work(Assets are those things who needs internet connections.Ex.,In our home there are some 5 assets which we can use on daily basis such as TV,Wifi,Mobile,AC,Smartwatch,etc.)
    </p>
    <p>>Audits:
        A careful check or examination of something to make sure everything is correct and follows rules.(Security checks which tell what activities we performed)In IT:Checking computers, software, and data to make sure they are safe, updated, and properly used.
        IT audits = Stored digitally in reports, databases, or system logs to track assets and security.
    </p>
    <p>>General meaning of Compliance:
        Compliance = Following rules, laws, regulations, or standards that apply to you or your organization.
    </p>
    <p>>Asset Compliance:
        Asset Compliance = Making sure all IT assets (computers, software, servers, network devices, etc.) follow the rules, standards, and policies set by the organization or law.
        Who decides the rules for Asset Compliance?
        Government / Regulatory Authorities üèõÔ∏è
        They make laws and regulations that companies must follow.
        Example:
        GDPR ‚Üí Europe‚Äôs data privacy law
        HIPAA ‚Üí Health data law in the USA
        IT Act / Cybersecurity laws ‚Üí India

        Industry Standards / Organizations üìä
        Groups set best practices and standards that companies follow voluntarily or by requirement.
        Example:
        ISO 27001 ‚Üí Information security management
        CIS Benchmarks ‚Üí Security configurations for systems

        Company / Internal Policies üè¢
        Each company makes its own rules for employees and IT systems.
        Example:
        Password policies
        Which software is allowed
        Backup rules for data
    </p>
    <p>>Obsolescence:
        Obsolescence = When something becomes old, outdated, or no longer useful because newer or better versions exist.
        IT Asset Obsolescence = When an IT asset (like a computer, server, software, or device) becomes outdated, no longer supported, or cannot meet current business or security needs.
        Why IT Asset Obsolescence Matters:
        Increases security risks (old systems may have vulnerabilities).
        Reduces productivity (slow or incompatible systems).
        Causes higher maintenance costs.
        Can lead to non-compliance with industry or legal rules.
    </p>
    <p>>Vulnerability:
        Vulnerability = A weak spot in IT systems that can cause security problems.(Viruses or any )
        Examples in IT:
        Software Vulnerability-
        A bug in Windows, Linux, or an application that hackers can use to break in.
        Hardware Vulnerability-
        A flaw in a server or network device that makes it insecure.
        Network Vulnerability-
        Open ports, weak passwords, or unsecured Wi-Fi that attackers can exploit.
    </p>
    <p>>Cloud Computing:Cloud computing means using the internet to access storage, servers, software, or databases instead of keeping them on your own computer.Example: Instead of saving all files on your laptop, you save them in Google Drive (cloud storage).
    You don‚Äôt need to buy heavy servers or software; you just ‚Äúrent‚Äù them from the cloud provider (like AWS,Azure)</p>
    <p>>SAAS:It is a cloud service where you use software through the internet without installing it on your computer.
    You just log in and start using it.
    The provider handles updates, security, and maintenance.
    Examples of SaaS:<ul>
        <li>Gmail (email service)</li>
        <li>Google Docs / Microsoft Office 365 (document editing)</li>
        <li>Canva (design tool)</li>
        <li>Zoom (video meetings) </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
